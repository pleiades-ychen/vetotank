Have the nominal spectra of primary emission, primary absorption length,
   WLS emission, and WLS absorption length in place. The files are listed
   below:
   LAB_PPO_Emission.dat  
   LAB_PPO_ABSLength.dat  
   (LAB_TMB_PPO_Emission.dat
   LAB_TMB_PPO_ABSLength.dat)
   bis-MSB_Emission.dat	
   bis-MSB_ABSLength.dat
   The two files for related to TMB will be used later when perform 
   LAB+30%TMB simulations.

Include the steel box;
Change the size of logical holder and world to debug the overlaps 
    with steel box, and use the class scint_box in LogicalHolder.cc
    instead of the Scintillator to extract geometry info;
Leave the update of WLS ABS and EM in progress.  

Updates:
Yu Chen

Update the scint ABSLength with the data measured for LAB+PPO+bisMSB mixture;
Change name "coating" to "teflon" for default reflector, 
   and make a new one, "lumirror";
Use real density and chemical formula for lumirror instead of those for teflon;

Yu Chen
08/06/2014
Use LUT model for lumirror surface;
Use measured data of lumirror reflectance;
Had updated material properties for LAB + PPO + bisMSB liquid scintillator;
Had used measured primary emission data of the ternary scintillator, w/o WLS;
Had kept all the other optical properties with the default data.

Corrected X's of fiber bundle locations

08/01/2014
Changed batch run mode as with: vetotank myrun.mac myoutput
Added macros directry, and created Na22g_NE.mac, etc for 9 source locations

Migration to Geant4.10.0.2:
   * In vetotankPhysics.cc, remove SetModel() method call for optical process;
   * In vetotankPhysics.cc, substitute header inclusion MuNuclearInteration.hh
     with MuonNuclearProcess.hh;
   * In all relevant .cc files, explicitly include headers "G4SystemOfUnits.hh"
     and "G4PhysicalConstants.hh".
Building geometry for 1/4-scale prototype (in progress):
   * Add files prototype.cc &.hh, scint_box.cc & .hh 
   * Implement major geometry of 1/4-scale box shape,
   * Have acrylic tank, paint, and scintillator bulk.
   * Need to specify correct MPT's for every part

mainly as same as Benton Pahlka's original version,
with sectorial aligned fiber array (June 2013)
